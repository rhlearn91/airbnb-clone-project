Description

Property Listing View

Displays a grid or list of available properties with basic info like image, name, price, and location. Includes search and filter options.

Listing Detailed View

Provides detailed information about a specific property, including more images, amenities, price breakdown, location map, and a booking button.

Simple Checkout View

Allows the user to confirm booking details, input basic personal information, select payment method, and complete the booking process quickly.

üí° Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System:

A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system because:

It reduces friction, making it easy for users to find and book properties quickly.

A simple, clean interface builds user trust and encourages more bookings.

Efficient design reduces abandonment rates during checkout by minimizing steps and confusion.

It enhances overall user satisfaction and loyalty, which is crucial for repeat business and referrals.

A poorly designed system can frustrate users, causing them to leave the platform and use competitors instead. Prioritizing UI/UX is key to the success of the AirBnB Clone project.
